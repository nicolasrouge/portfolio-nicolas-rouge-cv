## About

> I've got various IT related professional experiences (based in Paris, France and Manchester, UK). 
I also have a real interest in technology resulting in the fact that I create projects 
and do technological watch during my free time. 

These various experiences allowed me to work with 
a large range of tech/stack (C#, JavaScript are my favourites)
in different sectors (connected Fleet/Telematics, Banking and Public Health sector)
working for international clients (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§, ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·, ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³, ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º, ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±)

At this day Iâ€™m seeking a position within an organization who aims to, build, and improve solutions through technology. 
Iâ€™m ready to create, solve and innovate by playing a key role to in the implementation of software solutions.

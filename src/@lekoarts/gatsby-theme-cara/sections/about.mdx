> Currently occupying a Full-Stack Web Developer role in Manchester, and beforehand I’ve been graduated with a Software
Engineering Master's Degree in Paris, realized 3 internships, several projects, and a volunteering experience all IT related.

These various experiences allowed me to work with a large range of tech/stack in different sectors (connected Fleet/Telematics, Banking
and Public Health sector). At this day I’m seeking a Full Stack developer role in London with the objective to find a position within an
organization who aims to, build, and improve solutions through technology. I’m ready to create, solve and innovate by playing a key
role to in the implementation of software solutions.
